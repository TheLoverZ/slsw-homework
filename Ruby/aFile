For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
But I am certain that he who will take up my cause is living, and that in time to come he will take his place on the dust;
And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:
And ... without my flesh I will see God;
Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
Whom I will see on my side, and not as one strange to me. My heart is broken with desire.
